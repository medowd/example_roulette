# example_roulette
Program to refactor that plays a game of roulette

Names: Brenna Milligan and Elizabeth Dowd

1. The ```Game``` class is much more readable and extensible, because we got rid of the "if..else if...else if...." statements.
2. There are more classes, but that also means that the code is more modularized.
3. We didn't feel there were any major trade-offs.
4. We definitely prefer the new code, because it is more readable and extensible. For example, it was very easy to add three new types of bets.
